# OPTIMIZE

A Hack Club YSWS (You Ship, We Ship) program challenging developers to build memory-efficient desktop applications. Create something incredible under strict memory limits and win RAM upgrades for your setup

## ðŸ“‹ Project Submission

To submit your project to the showcase:

1. Visit the [submission form](https://forms.hackclub.com/t/fmL5xGZng2us)
2. Fill in your project details
3. Include a screenshot of your application
4. Provide both source code and demo links
5. Your project will appear in the showcase once approved

### The Challenge
Build something incredible under strict memory limits. The less memory your app uses, the bigger your reward.

### Prize Tiers
Memory efficiency determines your reward tier:

#### Efficient Coder (Getting Started)
- **Memory Limit**: <200MB runtime usage
- **Time Commitment**: 6+ hours on Hackatime
- **Reward**: 8GB RAM upgrade

#### Optimization Master (Pushing Limits)
- **Memory Limit**: <100MB runtime usage  
- **Time Commitment**: 10+ hours on Hackatime
- **Reward**: 16GB RAM upgrade

#### Memory Virtuoso (Peak Performance)
- **Memory Limit**: <50MB runtime usage
- **Time Commitment**: 20+ hours on Hackatime
- **Reward**: 32GB RAM upgrade

### Technical Requirements

**Core Functionality:**
- Minimum 4 distinct features
- 1 main complex feature demonstrating real functionality
- Cross-platform compatibility preferred
- Open source code on GitHub
- Executable binary for testing

**Optimization Requirements:**
- At least 2 genuine memory optimization techniques used
- Document optimization techniques and architecture decisions
- Memory usage measured during runtime with typical operations

**Mandatory Tracking:**
- **Hackatime tracking is REQUIRED** - install the plugin for your code editor
- Projects without proper Hackatime tracking will be disqualified
- Time requirements vary by tier (see above)

### Memory Measurement
- Memory usage measured during runtime while performing typical operations
- Peak memory usage determines your tier

**Program ends**: August 8th, 2025
